 == HALOGY 1.2 Backup ===

 Sorry dudes and dudets but I only have v1.2, If you must I could release
 another version close to v1.3 but be reminded a lot has been stripped out 
 for simplicity for my learning sakes.
 
 Remember if you believe in this project and can contribute by any means of fixes
 or even just reporting a problem you may have please do. It helps keep it alive.
 
 Oh and don't fret just yet, Jesse is still working on the new version.
